# Spoyt

Discord bot that allows you to "convert" Spotify links to YouTube videos.

## Usage

1. Invite the bot with this link: <https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=948274806325903410&permissions=2147485696&scope=bot%20applications.commands>.

1. Use `/track` or `/playlist` command to search. Bot will try to find the track or playlist (respectively) using Spotify API, and search it in YouTube (also using API).

### Note

YouTube searching currently applies only to `/track`. I'm currently inspecting YouTube API limiations.
